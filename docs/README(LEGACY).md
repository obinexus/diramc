## 📚 About

DIRAM is an evolutionary-inspired memory system designed for **fault-tolerant, runtime-hot-swappable CLI-driven environments**. Built with OBINexus's Hot-Wiring philosophy, DIRAM enables dynamic, directed evolution of instruction pathways to maximize signal stability and system adaptability under extreme conditions (think cosmic radiation, edge nodes, and beyond).

### Core Philosophy
Just like directed evolution in genetics selects traits for higher performance, DIRAM selects, stores, and transmits instructions through intelligent memory flows — not random chaos. This represents the intentional evolution of instruction pathways from passive storage to active, directive-driven intelligence.

## 🧩 Integration Use Case

### **Satellite Edge Node Cosmic Radiation Recovery**
DIRAM detects signal drift due to radiation, hot-swaps error regulation modules seamlessly, applies evolutionary corrections, and gracefully degrades performance—all while maintaining operational integrity.

**Technical Sequence:**
1. **Detection**: Signpass drift exceeds cosmic threshold
2. **Evolution**: Apply directed mutation pressure based on radiation intensity
3. **Hot-Swap**: Replace error_regulator component via CLI without interruption
4. **Correction**: Implement trie-based error correction with sub-logarithmic complexity
5. **Degradation**: Maintain graceful performance degradation with observable fallback paths
6. **Logging**: Document intervention path for downstream evolutionary learning

### **Industrial IoT Thermal Management**
In high-temperature manufacturing environments, DIRAM continuously monitors thermal feedback, evolutionarily adapts instruction pathways for heat resistance, and dynamically adjusts signal processing components.
